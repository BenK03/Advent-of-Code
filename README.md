### 🎄 My Advent of Code Solutions
---
This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code, an annual series of programming challenges released daily in December.

### 🤔 What is Advent of Code?
---
Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly programming event that publishes one puzzle per day, each designed to test problem-solving, algorithms, and implementation skills.

### 🧑‍🔧 Why am I participating?
---
I use Advent of Code to:
* Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
* Improve my Go skills and enhance proficiency in Python
* Work on problems that differ from typical coursework or LeetCode-style questions

### 🗂️ Repository Structure

* Each year folder contains that year’s AoC solutions
* Each day folder contains the solution(s) for that specific puzzle
